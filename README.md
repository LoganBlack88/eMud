# eMUD

eMud is a side project I'm working on to create a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) client using the Electron platform.

I'm building this mainly for fun, but also because MUDs have constituted probably the most significant portion of my
gaming career (both in hours played and over-all impact on my gaming life and tastes) and I want to show that niche 
corner of gaming some modern love.


_**Notice:** eMud is still under development, and not a viable MUD client option at this time._
